## Estimating Cost of Equity

This project demonstrates the process of estimating the cost of equity for a stock using the CAPM model and historical data from Yahoo Finance. It involves downloading data, performing regression analysis to determine beta, and calculating the cost of equity.

The implementation includes a Python script to automate these steps, providing a clear and concise method to estimate the cost of equity for given stocks.
